The files here were used to make the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard from the Module 12 Challenge. Customizations to the HTML were made to change fonts, background colors and included descriptions for all three graphs. All three graphs are able to be pulled from the samples.json file and navigate by default to the highlighted 940 sample that was of interest during the module.
